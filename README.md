# Password Breach Checker
This program allows you to check if a password has been breached using the Pwned Passwords API. It helps you assess the security of your passwords and identify if they have been compromised in any known data breaches.

# Usage
Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
pip install requests
pip install hashlib
Run the program in your Python environment.

Enter a password when prompted, and the program will check if the password has been breached.

The program will display the breach status of the password, indicating whether it has been compromised or not.

# Dependencies
requests: This library is used for making HTTP requests to the Pwned Passwords API.
Please note that this program now uses the Pwned Passwords API instead of the XposedOrNot API for improved functionality and reliability.
